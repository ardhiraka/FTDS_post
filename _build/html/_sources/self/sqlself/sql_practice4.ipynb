    "### SQL COUNT\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting all rows\n",
    "COUNT is a SQL aggregate function for counting the number of rows in a particular column. COUNT is the easiest aggregate function to begin with because verifying your results is extremely simple. Let's begin by using * to select all rows from the Apple stock prices dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*)\n",
    "  FROM hacktiv8.aapl_historical_stock_price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting individual columns\n",
    "Things start to get a little bit tricky when you want to count individual columns. The following code will provide a count of all of rows in which the high column is not null.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(high) AS count_high\n",
    "  FROM hacktiv8.aapl_historical_stock_price\n",

    "### SQL SUM\n",
    "\n",
    "SUM is a SQL aggregate function. that totals the values in a given column. Unlike COUNT, you can only use SUM on columns containing numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query below selects the sum of the volume column from the Apple stock prices dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SUM(volume)\n",

    "### SQL MIN/MAX\n",
    "\n",
    "MIN and MAX are SQL aggregation functions that return the lowest and highest values in a particular column.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're similar to COUNT in that they can be used on non-numerical columns. Depending on the column type, MIN will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as close alphabetically to \"A\" as possible. As you might suspect, MAX does the opposite—it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to \"Z.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following query selects the MIN and the MAX from the numerical volume column in the Apple stock prices dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT MIN(volume) AS min_volume,\n",
    "       MAX(volume) AS max_volume\n",

    "AVG is a SQL aggregate function that calculates the average of a selected group of values. It's very useful, but has some limitations. First, it can only be used on numerical columns. Second, it ignores nulls completely. You can see this by comparing these two queries of the Apple stock prices dataset:\n",

    "### SQL GROUP BY\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL aggregate function like COUNT, AVG, and SUM have something in common: they all aggregate across the entire table. But what if you want to aggregate only part of a table? For example, you might want to count the number of entries for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations like this, you'd need to use the GROUP BY clause. GROUP BY allows you to separate data into groups, which can be aggregated independently of one another. Here's an example using the Apple stock prices dataset:\n",

    "SELECT year,\n",

    "### SQL HAVING\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you'll often encounter datasets where GROUP BY isn't enough to get what you're looking for. Let's say that it's not enough just to know aggregated stats by month. After all, there are a lot of months in this dataset. Instead, you might want to find every month during which AAPL stock worked its way over $400/share. The WHERE clause won't work for this because it doesn't allow you to filter on aggregate columns—that's where the HAVING clause comes in:\n",

    "The CASE statement is SQL's way of handling if/then logic. The CASE statement is followed by at least one pair of WHEN and THEN statements—SQL's equivalent of IF/THEN in Excel. Because of this pairing, you might be tempted to call this SQL CASE WHEN, but CASE is the accepted term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every CASE statement must end with the END statement. The ELSE statement is optional, and provides a way to capture values not specified in the WHEN/THEN statements. CASE is easiest to understand in the context of an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "Subqueries (also known as inner queries or nested queries) are a tool for performing operations in multiple steps. For example, if you wanted to take the sums of several columns, then average all of those values, you'd need to do each aggregation in a distinct step.\n",

    "Subqueries can be used in several places within a query, but it's easiest to start with the FROM statement. Here's an example of a basic subquery:\n",

    "If you were to run this on its own, it would produce a result set like any other query. It might sound like a no-brainer, but it's important: your inner query must actually run on its own, as the database will treat it as an independent query. Once the inner query runs, the outer query will run using the results from the inner query as its underlying table:\n",

    "A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the rows retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.\n",

In this case, they are given the same rank, whereas ROW_NUMBER() gives them different numbers.
